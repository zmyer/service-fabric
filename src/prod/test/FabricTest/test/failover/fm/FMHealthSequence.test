# This test case covers the scenario where the entries having the highest sequence number are deleted. This happens
# when one or more services (and hence the corresponding partitions) are deleted. For each health entity type, FM
# should keep the entry with highest health sequence number. This is to ensure that after a FM failover, the new FM
# has the latest health sequence number available when it loads the state from disk.
