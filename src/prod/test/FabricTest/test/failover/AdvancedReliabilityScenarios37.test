# RA should treat DeleteReplica as an acknowledgement of ReplicaUp from FM
# In this test there is on the node 40
# - Closed volatile replica R1
# - Open Persisted replica R2
# - A persisted IB primary on the FM for which AddPrimary has not been received by RA R3
# The node is taken down and the service for R1 is deleted
# When the node comes up Reopen is blocked which will prevent ReplicaUp with IsLast = true from being sent because R2 is not reopened
# RA will send R1 in ReplicaUp. ReplicaUpReply is blocked
# FM will send DeleteReplica to RA. RA will mark the replica as deleted
# Now unblock reopen and addprimary and replica up reply
# At this point R3 should get built if everything is correct
# Due to the bug, the delete replica when processed will not clear the ReplicaUpReply pending flag which will cause RA to not send LastReplicaUp
set DummyPLBEnabled true
