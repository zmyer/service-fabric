#Reopen tests

#The aim is to test scenarios where the reopen of a persisted service takes a long time
#In such cases the RA will send all the replicas for which reopen is still pending as down
#And set the last replica up flag to true

#This should enable FM to figure out if the service needs to be deleted etc and the FM
#can then tell the RA to drop the service

#In this scenario there is an app which in v1 registers two services ServiceName1 (ST1) and ServiceName2 (ST2)
#This app is created and placed
#One of the secondaries that contained this app is brought down 
#fabric:/ServiceName1 is deleted
#Then app is upgraded to v2. In v2 it only registers ST2 and creates ServiceName2
#Then the down node is brought up
#It will try to reopen the replica for ServiceName1 which was present earlier
#This reopen is not possible because the service type for that is never going to be registered
#After the ReopenSuccessWaitInterval expires the RA will send this as a down replica and last replica up flag will be set
#This will cause the FM to do a ReplicaUpReply and tell the RA that this service has been deleted
#RA should then cancel the reopen of this (ServiceType has not been registered) and Close this FT
